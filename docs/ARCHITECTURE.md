# EvoMind System Architecture

## Overview

EvoMind implements a production-ready AI agent system that can dynamically create and execute tools. The architecture follows modern software engineering practices with focus on security, observability, and scalability.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Agent Controller
The brain of the system that orchestrates all operations.

### 2. Planning System
Implements ReAct (default), Tree of Thoughts (complex tasks), and Reflexion (learning).

### 3. Code Generation
Generates Python code using PAL (Program-Aided Language) approach.

### 4. Sandbox Executor
Provides isolated execution environment with resource limits.

### 5. Tool Registry
Manages tool lifecycle, versioning, and discovery.

### 6. Observability
Comprehensive monitoring with metrics, logging, and audit trails.

## Security Architecture

Defense in depth with multiple validation layers:
- Input validation
- Static code analysis
- Sandbox isolation
- Output sanitization

## Scalability Patterns

- Horizontal scaling with stateless controllers
- Queue-based execution
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Resource quotas

For detailed architecture information, see the inline documentation in the codebase.
